The inpainting seems to complete at 600 iterations with Huber Regularization.
Actually there is a limited aritfact even at 800 and 1000 iterations.

Comparison of Huber and Quadratic Regularization
 * With Quadratic, we can alredy see a significant change in 100 iterations, the change is 
   gradual with Huber Regularization. 
 * At iterations > 600, the output seems almost same for each.
